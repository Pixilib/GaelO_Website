# Personal data policy

Updated on 01/10/2021

## Preamble

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on May 25, 2018 and completes the legislation on personal data protection. For your information, a personal data corresponds to any information relating to a natural person identified or who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more elements that are specific to him (name, first name, address, email, telephone...).

The processing of personal data refers to any operation on this type of data (collection, storage, transmission, deletion, etc.), whether on paper or by computer. The data controller is the person who determines the purposes of each processing and the means to achieve these purposes.

The company reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will take effect immediately.

Therefore, we invite you to regularly consult our Policy in order to keep informed of the latest applicable online version.

## Purpose of the data processing

The recipients of the data are:

### Legal basis

The company Pixilib collects your personal data for the purposes described in the point "Purpose of processing" of this Policy.

In all cases, the company Pixlib collects your data, only when their collection and processing are based on a legal basis. Subject to having obtained your prior consent, the company Pixilib may process your data to send you commercial offers on its products and services.

### Security

The company Pixilib implements all technical, physical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of your data during the collection, processing and transfer of your data.

The infrastructure of the company Pixilib is protected against malicious software; the security of your terminal is your responsibility.

In the event that we are likely to call upon service providers to process part of your data, we undertake to verify that they present sufficient guarantees to ensure the protection of personal data entrusted to them and to have them sign confidentiality clauses in accordance with Article 28 of the RGPD. In the event of a personal data breach, i.e. a security incident, whether malicious or not and whether intentional or unintentional, that results in the compromise of the integrity, confidentiality or availability of your personal data, we undertake to comply with the following obligations:

The data breach does not create a risk: Internal documentation, in the "breach log".
The data breach creates a risk: Internal documentation, in the "breach register", notification to the CNIL, within a maximum of 72 hours.
The data breach creates a high risk: Internal documentation, in the "breach register", notification to the CNIL, within a maximum of 72 hours and we inform you as soon as possible.

The "register of violations" contains the following elements:

* The nature of the violation ;
* The categories and the approximate number of persons concerned;
* The categories and approximate number of files involved;
* The likely consequences of the breach;
* The measures taken to remedy the breach and, where appropriate, to limit the negative consequences of the breach;

Otherwise, the justification for not notifying the CNIL or informing the persons concerned.

However, and in accordance with the regulations in force, we are not obliged to inform you of a breach in the following cases

- Your personal data is protected by measures that make it incomprehensible to anyone who is not authorized to access it;
- Measures have been taken so that the risk is no longer likely to occur; or
- This communication requires disproportionate efforts on our part, especially since we have no means of contacting you to inform you about it.

## Responsibility

In order to meet our responsibilities, our company :

* Adopts internal procedures in order to ensure compliance with the regulation (IT charter, personal data protection charter) ;
* Keeps a documentary trace of any processing carried out under its responsibility or that of the subcontractor (keeping of the processing register, confidentiality agreements of employees and service providers, company security policy, procedures for managing requests for access, rectification, opposition...);
* Carries out impact analyses (PIA) for processing operations presenting particular risks with regard to rights and freedoms.

## Your rights regarding your data

You can access and obtain a copy of the data concerning you, oppose the processing of this data, have it rectified or deleted. You also have the right to limit the processing of your data.

The data protection correspondent is your contact for any request to exercise your rights.

Any request must specify, in the subject line, the reason for the request (exercise of the right of access, opposition, etc.). The request must also be accompanied by a copy of both sides of a valid identity card bearing the signature of the applicant and specify the address to which the response should be sent.

The company Pixilib will send you its answer within a maximum of one (1) month, from the date of receipt of your request. This period may however be extended by two (2) months due to the complexity and number of requests.
